## LinkedList Manipulation

- **File**: `LinkedList/linkedList.ts`
- **Task**: Implemented a TypeScript class for a linked list with methods to `add`, `remove`, and `find` elements.
- **Focus**: Class-based data structure and node manipulation.

### Running the LinkedList

```bash
cd LinkedList
npm install
npx ts-node linkedList.ts
```

## Temperature Converter

- **Main Files**: `tempConverter/src/App.tsx`, `tempConverter/src/TempConverter.tsx`
- **Task**: Implemented a class-based React component in TypeScript that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
- **Focus**: Class components in React, TypeScript classes, and handling of state and props.

### Running the Temperature Converter

```bash
cd tempConverter
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the provided localhost URL in your browser.

## Assessment Completion

This project demonstrates understanding of:
- TypeScript classes and generics
- Linked list data structure implementation
- React class components and state management
- Type safety in both pure TypeScript and React with TypeScript
